Tech assesment
First I import some library for using
Numpy,matplotlib,pandas,tenserflow,keras
For audio ii have used speech recognization
Speech recognition
speech recognition, also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition, or speech-to-text, is a capability which enables a program to process human speech into a written format. While it’s commonly confused with voice recognition, speech recognition focuses on the translation of speech from a verbal format to a text one whereas voice recognition just seeks to identify an individual user’s voice.
Then I trained the dataset via using
In complete model replace X_train with a speech to text model's output so that model model would work on that

Note --After that I use google api for converting audio to text format which has some limitations 
That’s why the code will only check few audio not full audios 
Then I take text as an input and extract label from it 



And also I have calculate the confusion_matrix and f1 score 
For extracting the labels from an text we can use naïve wave classifier and also we can use lstm in rnn

In this project I have used naïve wave classifier and also bag of words model

F1 score
In statistical analysis of binary classification, the F1 score (also F-score or F-measure) is a measure of a test's accuracy. It considers both the precision p and the recall r of the test to compute the score: p is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all positive results returned by...
Also I have check the dimension of labels ,coloum format(action label ,object label,Location label)

And also I have convert it into yaml format
First I import the pickle 
Then use dump method in pickle for getting a file
The accuracy which I have find it –
77.05272255834004 %
